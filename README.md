## Homework for Lab 1 csm

write a Python script to input a value representing an amount in cents and will output the same amount using the fewest number of coins. For example, if the input is 46, the output should be:
```
>>> 46
1 quarter, 2 dimes and 1 penny
```

Make sure to test for singular and plural to avoid printing "1 quarters" or "2 dime".

## HomeWork for Lab 2 csm
In this assignment you will design a guessing game. Your program should generate a random number in a certain range and give the user a predefined number of tries to guess the number. I'm expecting to see something similar to the following when I test your program:
```
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. 
Guess what it is. You have 5 tries: 50
Nope! Too low. Try again (4 tries left): 75
Nope! Too high. Try again (3 tries left): 60
Nope! Too low. Try again (2 tries left): 70
Nope! Too high. Try again (1 try left): 65
Nope! You lost. The number was 62
Do you want to play again? (Y/N): Y
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. 
Guess what it is. You have 5 tries: 50
Nope! Too low. Try again (4 tries left): 75
You got it!
```

## Lab 3

### Prologue:
CIS-117 Lab3
This activity is about building a module using functions which converts currencies to dollars.
Group 1, Project 3
Dillon Anawalt and Sebastian Campos

### GOAL:
We need 6 functions in total related to conversion, this can be with dollars. To do so, we will convert American dollars to
Chinese dollars, Mexican dollars, British dollars, Canadian dollars, Russian dollars, Spanish dollars and vice-versa!

### NOTE:
Dollar value fluctuates over time so for all intents and purposes, we will keep the dollar value the way we discovered out of
convenience
