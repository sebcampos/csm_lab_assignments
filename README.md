## HomeWork for Lab 2 csm
In this assignment you will design a guessing game. Your program should generate a random number in a certain range and give the user a predefined number of tries to guess the number. I'm expecting to see something similar to the following when I test your program:
```
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. 
Guess what it is. You have 5 tries: 50
Nope! Too low. Try again (4 tries left): 75
Nope! Too high. Try again (3 tries left): 60
Nope! Too low. Try again (2 tries left): 70
Nope! Too high. Try again (1 try left): 65
Nope! You lost. The number was 62
Do you want to play again? (Y/N): Y
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. 
Guess what it is. You have 5 tries: 50
Nope! Too low. Try again (4 tries left): 75
You got it!
```
