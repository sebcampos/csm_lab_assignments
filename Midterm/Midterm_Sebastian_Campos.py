    The governing wisdom about writing sentences says not to repeat. 
    Repetition is bad. Repetition is sloppy. 
    Writers are encouraged to consult a thesaurus and change up that pesky offending word. 
    But is this really true? 
    Literature is full of repetition. 
    Literary writers constantly use the literary device of repeated words. 
    I think the only type of repetition which is bad is sloppy repetition. Repetition which is unintentional, 
    which sounds awkward. If you repeat on purpose, repetition is gorgeous. I mean, think about music. 
    Music is all about repetition and patterns. If you didnâ€™t have repetition in music, 
    it would all just be noise.
